How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
First, functionality is achieved through testing, both isolated and integrated. It is important to test code as you go and not wait until large portions are completed. 
Testing can be done through automation via JUnit tests. It is imperative to lend a sizeable amount of time to the writing of these tests to achieve a meaningful coverage of code.
As for security, testing is a great step in thwarting known security issues, but it is not the only way. Code can be ran with programs like Maven to search for and identify
vulnerabilities from a large database of historic attacks and known problems. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs takes some investigative skills. Listening to the users through ways such as surveys and user testing is a great start. Observing work flows and pinch points within a system allows you to add value to a system even if the user is not aware of a need for it at that time. Building a program around these needs can be a successful way to incorporate them into the system. 

How do I approach designing software?
My approach is, I am sure, of a novice nature. Heavy testing is needed in the beginning to ensure basic structure of code is readable first of all. Once I know the code is working, testing tapers off to the functionality of classes and methods, though not substantially minimized. Psuedocode and flowcharts can help tremendously as well.
